DDEXUI provides a user interface for supplying digital music in a [ddex](http://ddex.net/) compliant way. It aims to abstract the complexities of ddex for ease of use by smaller independent labels and artists.

DDEXUI is currently in development, but parts of the ddex spec have already been covered.
